# 82utils

## OverView
82Utils is a library of utils functions.

The 82Utils package has created its own small but annoying features.

It's good for someone like this to use.
- When the team needs to use the same Utils library
- Small but necessary functions, but when you don't want to make them
- When you need a variety of validation functions
- When you need to make the regular expression you need
- When time/date related functions and various formats are needed
- when random functions are needed
---

## Example
```js
npm install 82utils
```
```
import 82utils from '82utils'
```
